View 3-Min Demo ICD-10 Overview - ICD-10 Overview What is ICD-10 Importance of ICD-10 What is ICD-10? For decades the U.S. healthcare system relied on a set of codes, referred to as ICD-9, to report diagnoses and in-patient procedures. Introduced in the late 1970s, the ICD-9 code set was replaced by the more detailed ICD-10 code set on October 1, 2015. What is ICD-10? ICD stands for the International Classification of Diseases, and its codes hold critical information about epidemiology, managing health, and treating conditions. Healthcare professionals use ICD codes to record and identify health conditions. Public health workers can use the recording of ICD codes to see trends in health, and track morbidity and mortality. And insurers use ICD codes to classify conditions and determine reimbursement. The transition to ICD-10 reflected a five-fold increase in diagnosis codes, to roughly 69,000 codes and the transition to ICD-10 codes was required for anyone covered by the Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA)—this includes doctors, hospitals and health insurance companies, all of whom rely on these codes for diagnosing patients and billing for services. If a medical practice or insurance payer didn’t switch to ICD-10 by the deadline, they could be experiencing difficulties processing claims. Keep in mind, the transition does not affect or change the American Medical Association's CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) codes used for outpatient procedures.
