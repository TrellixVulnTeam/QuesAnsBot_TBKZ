Succeed in starting a medical practice.
athenahealth is uniquely positioned to help providers avoid the pains associated with starting a medical practice. Our services help you thrive, and keep you ahead of change..
Watch video.
Starting a medical practice with proven services.
Starting an independent medical practice often requires more business acumen than clinical know-how. Time spent with patients can feel rushed, and delivering care is filled with distractions..
But it doesn’t have to be that way when you’re partnered with a results-driven health IT industry leader. athenahealth understands the challenges for those starting a medical practice—and knows exactly how to help..
Low upfront costs, no long-term contracts.
At athenahealth, our success depends on yours. Our payment model aligns our financial incentives with your practice’s performance—we only get paid when you get paid. That’s why we’re committed to helping you drive results from day one, with low up-front costs so you can get started quickly..
To ensure you achieve those results, we offer you one comprehensive solution that’s always up to date. No hidden costs. No costly upgrades. No ongoing maintenance fees. No long-term contracts. And because our network spans more than 106,000 providers, we can identify the factors that impact their performance and advise you on the best ways to improve yours..
Taking on your busywork so providers can focus on care.
As a network-enabled service, we provide you more than a technology platform. We take on burdensome administrative tasks to reduce your workload, so that you can focus on the work that only you are qualified to do—like caring for patients..
”Whether scanning and sorting faxes, posting payments, following up on denials, completing eligibility checks, or making reminder calls, we take work off your hands, with a high degree of accuracy. Our Billing Rules Engine is always up to date, so you have the expertise you need to keep up with changing payer requirements, without hiring additional staff. I can’t imagine being a solo practitioner without an army of people like athena behind us. I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night.” - Dr. Eric Tiblier, Cardiac Clinic of Austin.
We guarantee our practices thrive through change.
athenaNet puts the right information at your fingertips, at the right time, whether it’s patient information, the latest clinical guidelines, or the most up-to-date requirements for quality programs. Our expert teams alleviate the burdens associated with Meaningful Use , MIPS and more, so you can keep up with the pace of change, without additional work or costs. Guaranteed..
“In starting up a new practice, there were literally hundreds and thousands of decisions to be made on any number of aspects of the practice and the business. And the one decision that I think was absolutely the right one and I wouldn't change again is choosing athena.”.
Ryan Frazine, MD Practice Owner Advanced Internal Medicine, Paducah, KY.
