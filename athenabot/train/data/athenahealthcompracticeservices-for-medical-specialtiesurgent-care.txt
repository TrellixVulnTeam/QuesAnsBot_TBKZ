Here’s how we free up your team to.
achieve more.
Collect more, faster, with less effort.
Increase time-of-service collections with real-time eligibility checking, documentation protocols, and a credit-card-on-file tool. You can also reduce denials, track claims, and handle follow-ups with our billing rules engine and support from our dedicated back-office team..
Get the visibility you need to grow.
With robust analytics and detailed reporting, you can view operational and financial performance across your locations to inform data-driven business decisions. And you can stay ahead of industry change with real-time knowledge of the latest payer requirements, regulations and reimbursement opportunities—right in your workflow..
Drive efficiency from check-in to check-out.
Manage patient volume more efficiently with online pre-registration, patient responsibility estimators and call-ahead online appointments. Our urgent care workflows and templates keep your staff productive, so they can get patients in and out faster..
Coordinate care across your operations.
With pre-established integrations, you can automatically connect to labs, hospitals, imaging centers, and other care settings — and easily communicate with new clinicians as your organization grows. Plus, easy-to-run email outreach campaigns get patients in the door for preventive care, such as flu vaccines, with greater efficiency..
