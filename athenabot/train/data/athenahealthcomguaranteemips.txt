Are you prepared for MIPS?.
With us as your partner, you will be. On the athenahealth® network, our quality program experts help you succeed at MIPS without taking on extra work..
Request more information.
Understanding the new Quality Payment Program – The MIPS track The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) creates a new framework for rewarding providers for better, lower-cost, patient-centered care. MACRA streamlines existing quality reporting programs into one new Quality Payment Program (QPP) with two tracks: the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) or Alternative Payment Model. Beginning in 2017, Eligible Clinicians 5 will be required to participate in one of these two tracks..
About 90 percent of Eligible Clinicians have qualified for the MIPS track in 2017. MIPS combines quality programs including Meaningful Use, PQRS, and Value Modifier and adds a new category, Clinical Practice Improvement Activities. Eligible Clinicians are scored and benchmarked against their peers. Your performance in 2017 affects your 2019 Medicare Part B payments..
