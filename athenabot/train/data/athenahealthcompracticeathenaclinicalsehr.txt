Not Just an EHR.
EHR Features.
A new kind of EHR.
At athenahealth, we think healthcare providers deserve technology that lets them focus on what really matters: patient care. So we created it. Designed with input from our providers, our new, streamlined electronic health record (EHR) helps you document faster, easily meet quality program requirements, and removes distractions that get in the way of care..
Finally, an EHR that’s easy to use.
More than half of medical practices believe their EHR has a negative impact on costs, efficiency or productivity 1 . That’s why we created an EHR that works the way you do. With athenahealth, you can take in the patient’s story at a glance and document with the natural flow of the conversation. Relevant clinical information is clearly communicated to other providers, so everyone on your care team can make the most informed decisions..
Designed to let you do your best work.
Our streamlined EHR lets providers do what they do best: care for their patients. Most electronic health record software available today disrupts the patient exam, creating extra work that isn’t the best use of a physician’s time. With our new workflow, a third of documentation is delegated to clinical staff, so providers can focus on delivering care..
Backed by best practices from 106,000 providers.
Because all of our providers are on a single network, not multiple instances of software, we can provide real-time decision support based on recommendations from providers like you. We track most frequently used orders within the EHR and suggest diagnoses. We can aggregate clinical information from multiple providers and surface it at the appropriate time. And because we can learn from top-performing clients, we can continuously, and seamlessly, improve your workflow based on those insights..
