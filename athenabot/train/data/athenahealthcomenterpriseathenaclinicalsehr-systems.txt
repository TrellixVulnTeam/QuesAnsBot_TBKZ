EHR overview.
Introducing athenaClinicals mobile.
Our new mobile solution untethers providers from their desktops and assists them in focusing on patients, wherever care is being delivered. Relevant clinical information is available at a glance and a speech-enabled experience enables faster, more accurate documentation. Providers also benefit from a consistent view of patient context, across acute and ambulatory settings, which reduces their need to synthesize and reinterpret information. For more information, please call 617-321-0600..
Organize—and improve—every moment of care.
We designed our EHR to keep providers productive and focused on patients. Before the patient enters the exam room, our EHR surfaces the most relevant data to help the provider make decisions. The intake process is optimized to ensure the provider isn't overwhelmed by data entry work. The patient-centered clinical narrative is easy to enter and easy to read..
Thanks to knowledge gained from our network, we're uniquely able to guide your providers to improve performance. Providers are coached based on KPIs and benchmarking from across the network to improve use, efficiency, and ROI. During the exam, providers entering a particular diagnosis are able to see suggested orders for that diagnosis, based on the experience of the network..
Satisfy quality measures for full payment.
Because we have a shared financial incentive to do so, we’ve made attesting to quality measures as simple and automatic as possible. Our Quality Performance team embeds program requirements into the workflow to inform care decisions and automate quality measure satisfaction. We take on the administrative work so your health system can receive full payment, without increasing the burden on providers or staff..
Close the loop on physician orders.
Our services ensure that physician orders are tracked through to completion. Our dedicated document service experts handle inbound faxes for your health system, matching results to the correct patient record so the provider sees the most up-to-date information..
