Don’t Leave Money on the Table.
What’s at stake with value based reimbursement? Here’s a look at an actual athenahealth client with a breakdown of the money they stand to lose and, more important, the money they can gain for the quality care they already deliver. This practice has 13% of their annual revenue in the balance. How much money is at stake at your practice?.

Avoid the penalties.
MIPS 2017: Failing to submit any data for MIPS (for Eligible Clinicians) in 2017 will result in a -4% revenue loss in 2019..
Get paid more with new revenue opportunities If you’re already managing chronic care or providing transitional care, you should be taking full advantage of higher reimbursements from Medicare through the Chronic Care Management (CCM) or the Transitional Care Management (TCM) programs. There are also substantial incentives in the Value-based Modifier (VM) program that are awarded to providers for high-quality, low-cost care. Our 5 MD practice above received an additional $355,702 through incentive payments in these programs..
* VM & HCC values based off of CMS’ 2015 x-factor: Page 3: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170615/ **CCM values based on CMS data that two out of three Medicare beneficiaries have two or more chronic conditions: Page 2: https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/ChronicCareManagement.pdf †TCM data based on CMS national average that 14% of beneficiaries have an inpatient episode followed by a post-acute visit: Page 16: https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Chronic-Conditions/Downloads/2012Chartbook.pdf.
We guarantee success with value-based care.
