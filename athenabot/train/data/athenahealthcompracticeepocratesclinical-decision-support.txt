Epocrates overview.
Clinical decision support that saves time at the point of care As providers struggle to maintain productivity from patient to patient, athenahealth is helping them save time and stay focused on care: We've embedded Epocrates drug monographs directly inside the athenaClinicals EHR..
No need to toggle between services, or open a new window on your laptop or tablet. The Epocrates information you rely on—dosing, contraindications and more—is already built into the workflow, for effective, efficient clinical decision support right in the prescribing moment..
Improving efficiency inside the patient encounter Epocrates information is just one source of clinical decision support integrated into our EHR. Clinical care guidelines and quality measures are also part of the workflow, surfacing where they're easiest for providers or staff to act upon..
The athenahealth Clinical Intelligence team researches the most relevant, up-to-date clinical guidelines and delivers them via our Quality Management Engine; the Engine places the right guidelines where they are least obtrusive - outside of the exam room as often as possible..
We believe an EHR should deliver optimal information with minimal distraction, and never get in the way of care. With athenahealth and Epocrates, providers can stay focused on patients and make decisions more efficiently—all while satisfying quality management program measures..
Anywhere, anytime convenience.
To complement Epocrates mobile clinical expertise, athenahealth's award-winning apps are designed to let doctors focus more on patients and keep schedules full..
With our EHR mobile app, physicians complete clinical tasks at their convenience. And the athenahealth mobile patient portal makes it a snap for patients to schedule appointments, make payments, and exchange secure messages with your staff—helping you satisfy the most challenging Meaningful Use Stage 2 measures..
