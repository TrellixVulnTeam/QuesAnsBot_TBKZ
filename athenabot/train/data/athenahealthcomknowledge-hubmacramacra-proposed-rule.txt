FAQs.
When did MACRA become official?.
CMS released its rule for MACRA (Medicare Access & CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015) in October, 2016. CMS’s goal for MACRA is to create a new framework for rewarding providers for better, lower-cost, patient-centered care..
The MACRA Final Rule introduced the Quality Payment Program (QPP) that is intended to simplify current Medicare reporting programs into two tracks.
The Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS), which covers most providers (MIPS combines former programs PQRS and MU).
Advanced Alternative Payment Models (APMs), which only applies to providers who are part of a risk-based payment model such as the Next Generation ACO or Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+) program..
A MACRA Summary.
MACRA affects most providers.
Unless you’re new to Medicare or bill very low Medicare volume, you can’t opt out..
Time is short You must report some data in 2017 to avoid penalties..
Expect an administrative burden The data collection and reporting can be extensive. Ensure you have an EHR that sets you up for success – and without extra work..
Meaningful Use is not going away.
MACRA does not change hospital or Medicaid MU. Medicaid MU participants who also bill Medicare will need to participate in both Medicaid MU (through 2021) and MIPS..
MACRA is here to stay MACRA was passed with bipartisan support, and is separate from the ACA. A repeal of the ACA does not mean a repeal of MACRA, so providers should expect it to continue to move forward..
Proposed quality scoring is public All reporting performances will be publicly reported on Medicare’s Physician Compare site..
