Helping community hospitals thrive.
Our proven approach for rural, critical access, and community hospitals includes our powerful network, continuously updated knowledge to keep you on top of change, and expert teams taking on administrative work at scale..
Boost your bottom line Our revenue cycle and financial management services help community hospitals boost cash flow, accelerate payments, and drive efficiency across your organization. We automate repetitive billing work, proactively address denials, and handle precertifications on your behalf. The result? You squeeze every cent out of every claim, giving you the time and financial resources to tackle high return projects and reinvest in your business. Drive better clinical quality and control Frustrating EHRs can be a significant source of clinician dissatisfaction—or even attrition. But our award-winning EHR surfaces the right data, right when your providers need it, and delivers a single patient record across your entire health system. We close the loop on orders and exchange information electronically with a wide range of partners, all so your physicians and clinical staff can spend less time in the EHR and more time caring for their patients. Become the provider of choice in your community We know your neighbors depend on you for employment and life-saving care. That’s why athenahealth is committed to the success of community hospitals like yours. With services for EHR, revenue cycle, patient engagement and care coordination, we’ll help you keep your doors open, so you can continue serving your community..
Our integrated ambulatory services drive results for our network of 106,000 providers — higher revenue, lower no-show rates, and more than $30.8 in collections on our clients’ behalf each quarter. As your partner, we align our financial success with yours: when you do well, we do well..
