no-show rate.
Why is it important?.
We calculate the percentage of our providers' total appointments within any month that are categorized as no-shows..
Every patient no-show in your schedule represents potential money not earned from a scheduled visit. By keeping no-show rates low, your practice can enjoy better financial health, successfully battling against the negative revenue drain of missed appointments..

days in accounts receivable.
Why is it important?.
Days in Accounts Receivable (DAR) represents the time it takes to receive payment for an outstanding claim. Tracking begins the day the claim was entered on the athenaNet network. Fewer days in DAR have a direct effect on improved cash flow. When claims are resolved quickly, practices are able to reduce their DAR and collect revenue faster..

days turn around time.
Why is it important?.
Turn Around Time measures how long it takes athenahealth clients' practice staff to charge billing slip information after patient services are delivered..
When your practice enters patient charges as soon as possible, you're more likely to enjoy greater revenue. Timely entry reflects a high level of efficiency reducing (or eliminating) misfiled or missing slips, or denials due to expired filing limits..

96%.
revenue realization rate.
Why is it important?.
This metric calculates the percentage of our providers' claims that are fully adjudicated—paid or adjusted—within six months of submission..
If your Revenue Realization Rate is high, especially on a consistent basis, that means your practice is enjoying a steady cash flow, with few claims needing extra attention in order to be resolved..

same-day close rate.
Why is it important?.
The Same-day Encounter Close Rate is the percentage of patient encounters at our clients' practices that are closed the same day as the visit..
Timely documentation of patient encounters is one of the best measures of an efficiently run practice, one that doesn't suffer backlogged encounters, and is generally prepared to file claims quickly and easily..

delegation of work.
Why is it important?.
The Delegation of Work measurement is the percentage of intake documentation at our providers' practices that has been assigned to staff..
When the appropriate documentation work is handed off to staff, providers can spend less time with the heavy burden of paperwork. This improves productivity and efficiency, and is a major contributor to running a profitable practice..
