Care coordination overview.
Bring in more patients, more efficiently.
Through direct scheduling, athenahealth helps you drive network alignment, schedule density, and patient compliance. Direct scheduling simplifies access for patients, as well as for referring providers sending patients to your health system. We provide the visibility you need to see and act on referral patterns in order to manage your network. As a result, our clients see an average 16% increase in network retention..
Gain visibility into patient activity.
The most open network of its kind, athenahealth gives you complete and automatic visibility into patient data. Providers can access patient data and share it with any other provider connected to the network. All referrals, orders, and results from providers on the network include essential demographic, clinical, and financial data. Incoming order results are automatically populated in the patient chart. In addition, with our secure medical texting service, athenaText® , providers can collaborate on patient care while remaining HIPAA-compliant..
See better results with less work.
All athenahealth clients are on the same network, so all clients benefit from every interface we build and maintain. On the network, your health system has immediate access to our pre-built connections to immunization registries, labs, public health agencies, and more, as well as to any third party connection we build. Our teams manage billions of transactions between providers each year, including the work needed to exchange information via phone, fax, or paper..
Need more functionality? Our rapidly growing marketplace features industry-leading third-party applications ready to integrate into your workflow..
