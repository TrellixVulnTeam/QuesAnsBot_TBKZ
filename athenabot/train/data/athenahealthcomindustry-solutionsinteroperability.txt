What does interoperability mean for you?.
Get the full picture of your patients’ care – regardless of where they get treatment..
Talk to an expert.
Connect with your critical care partners You need to exchange patient records with your local hospital and care sites across your community, but you need access that takes second, not weeks. Join athenahealth and become a part of the most connected network in the nation..
Our network-enabled model allows providers to exchange patient medical records seamlessly across the continuum–via the athenahealth client network, and our connections to the CommonWell and Carequality networks – regardless of the EHR in use at other care sites. In addition, our clients can plug into our array of global connections to major labs, imaging centers, health information exchanges, public health registries and payers..
Connect within your health system.
With your patients receiving care in both ambulatory clinics and in the hospital, it’s critical that providers have access to the most current and complete patient records in both settings to provide quality care. We have extensive experience integrating with inpatient systems and we ensure that providers have seamless access to the clinical and practice management data they need to deliver care across the organization..

Interoperability made easy.
At athenahealth, interoperability is a service, not a one-time project. We build the connections and monitor your data exchange around the clock to ensure data is flowing. This reduces IT costs for your organization, and minimizes the time required to connect with critical partners..
In addition, our network is constantly growing as we add more providers and build new connections. You’ll benefit from this growth without needing to do any additional work. That’s the power of being part of the network..
79% of physicians say that the majority of patients they treat also receive care outside their network (Epocrates, National Survey, 2015).
Connecting to other organizations typically requires building individual interfaces that can cost between $10K to $150k each.
95% of physicians have experienced difficulty in delivering care because patients’ health records were not accessible (Epocrates, National Survey, 2015).
We connect across your community.
Regardless of the EHR in use, your providers can easily access patient data through our connections with:.
